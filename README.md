# About

Realtime weather app that shows the current weather. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather of a city entered in the search bar and displays it on the screen. 
It helped me understand better the core basics of the DOM and I got to practice how to use fetch API, to call and get data from a third-party service.

### Inspiration

My parents always ask their Siri about the weather, especially on vacation so I decided to put together a weather website for them. <3
